## Personal Goals: 
To become more comfortable with React JS -- at an intermediate level as a React developer;
looking to bridge the gap between design and development. I feel like I am learning React and still have more to learn before building a polished website.
I have great designs but have struggled on perfectly implementing them in practice. Im a developer who wants to be able to build any website design that's handed to them.
I want to master responsive design and Im looking for a better understanding of UX/UI design principles
This method gives a faster way to get up and running with clean, consistently designed applications, to practice a higher skill set with these supports.
