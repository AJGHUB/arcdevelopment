**This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
SEO in React > switch to Next.js || Google Analytics for data-driven decisions integrated animations from After Effects**


## Tech Content I am learning with this build project:
- This project is built with the preprogrammed create-react-app, and utilises React Router, and Material-UI design concepts.
- This build applications will sit well on every screen with Material-UI's responsive design system
- Insights are gained to different image optimization strategies.
- Im wanting to create a theme for my application by mastering Material-UI's centralized styling system.
- Learn how to use responsive design to ensure this applications look perfect on any screen size and orientation.
- Use the Material-UI grid system to align complex layouts perfectly.
- Export animations from Adobe After Effects and efficiently importing them into a React application with react-lottie.
- Leverage serverless functionality with Google Firebase Cloud Functions.
- Implement sending emails through Node.js
- Make network requests in React while displaying feedback like loading spinners with Material-UI.
- Migrating a project from create-react-app to Next.js and learn why.
- Research Cross-browser testing and support.
- Deploying a Next.js project and add a custom domain name -- for two different hosting platforms.
- Code Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in the React applications.
- Incorporate Google Analytics to collect data about who is interacting with this application and what they're doing.
- Build custom organizational functionality to control data displayed in tables including search, filtering, delete, and undo.

2. To build an application that looks perfect on every screen with Material-UI's responsive design system
3. Refine UX/UI design intuition and see concepts in action
4. Implement Search Engine Optimization in React JS
5. Migrate from create-react-app to Next JS
6. Use serverless functions with Firebase
7. Export and efficiently integrate animations with react-lottie
8. Collect data and track events with Google Analytics in React JS
9. Ensure cross-browser support with my styles in Material-UI

## Personal Goals 
**To become more comfortable with React JS at an intermediate level as a React developer**
looking to bridge the gap between design and development. I feel like I am learning React and still have more to learn before building a polished website.
I have great designs but have struggled on perfectly implementing them in practice. Im a developer who wants to be able to build any website design that's handed to them.
I want to master responsive design and Im looking for a better understanding of UX/UI design principles
This method gives a faster way to get up and running with clean, consistently designed applications, to practice a higher skill set with these supports.



Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
